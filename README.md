# Operating System and Compiler Design Lab Manual

Welcome to the Operating System (OS) and Compiler Design (CD) Lab Manual repository by Shalu Gupta, Assistant Professor at MGM-COET.

This lab manual covers various aspects of operating systems and language translation, providing a comprehensive guide for students to understand and implement these concepts in a practical lab setting.

## Overview

The manual is divided into two parts:

### Part A: Operating System (OS) Lab

Part A focuses on:

- Simulating CPU scheduling algorithms
- Memory management techniques
- Deadlock avoidance and prevention algorithms
- Page replacement algorithms
- Designing lexical analyzers
- Implementing lexical analyzers using lex tools
- Designing parsers for a given language

### Part B: Compiler Design (CD) Lab

Part B delves into:

- Implementation of a lexical analyzer using lex tools
- Implementation of a predictive parser for a given language
- Other programming tasks related to language translation
